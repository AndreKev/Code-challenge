# Code-challenge
Do you like solving algorithms problem ? This repository gathers questions and solution to pack of algorithms challenges. Algorithms will be implemented in python and in c++. Every language has it's own facilites, hence its own code. Get familiar with yours. In each problem, you will find the problem statement to let you solve it on your own. You will find aside the analysis used in solving the problems, the choice we made and the code in python, c++.
